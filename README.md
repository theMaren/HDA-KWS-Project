# Human data analytics: Key Word Spotting
This repository showcases our project for the Human Data Analytics course at the University of Padova, academic year 2023/24. Focused on keyword spotting, a core task in speech recognition used for example in voice assistants like Amazon Alexa. We used the [Google Speech Commands dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/speech_commands) for our research. We explored various audio preprocessing techniques and neural network architectures, evaluating their performance and ressource consumption.

## Notebooks

### complete_preprocessing.ipynb
This notebook presents an exploratory analysis of the dataset and details our preprocessing pipeline. It covers various audio data transformations into images and data downsampling techniques.

### Baseline_model.ipynb
This notebook outlines our baseline model, against which our developed models are benchmarked. The model design follows guidelines from the [TensorFlow audio recognition tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/audio/simple_audio).
